This repository contains my thesis codebase.

### Steps to run the code:

1. Run tfidf.py in scripts folder to generate the csv files for 3-gram binary data.
2. Run predict_mlp.py to predict using neural network.

* Note: Link for all the csv files that are generated using tfidf.py is provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ydz1TosElk5TGDZ7I-py6rU_J-54VAWK?usp=sharing). Please change the name of the csv files in predict scripts too accordingly.
